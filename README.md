#Differential Amplifier
The project involves the design and analysis of a differential amplifier, a core analog circuit used to amplify the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise. It was implemented and simulated using Cadence Virtuoso, focusing on parameters like gain, CMRR, and biasing stability.
